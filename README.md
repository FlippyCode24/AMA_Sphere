# Brittle Gamblers 

## Basic Information
A gambling simulation website dedicated to lotto and RNG offers users an immersive virtual experience without the involvement of real money. Users can enjoy simulated lotto draws and other RNG-based activities, experiencing the excitement of the games without financial risk.

Additionally, customer support services are available to address any queries or concerns users may have while participating in the virtual lotto experience.

 ## Purpose
 The purpose of our Project is to simulate gambling habits involving creating a program that replicates how individuals engage in gambling activities. This process entails understanding various factors influencing gambling behavior, defining simulation parameters, modeling decision-making processes, incorporating randomness, tracking finances, analyzing results, iteratively improving the simulation, and addressing ethical considerations. This repository can be used to make research about gambling habits just make the respondents play in this site.
